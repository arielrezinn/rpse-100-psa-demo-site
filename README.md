This is a website (https://psa.arielrezin.com/) created for use in an assignment for RPSE 100 at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The assignment was a video PSA, which can be viewed at (https://youtu.be/uVDxSZiQc3I).

Due to time constraints, the site has not been fully tested for accessibility errors and is not WCAG 2.1 AA compliant. That said, some errors (such as low contrast) are intentional and are used for demonstration purposes.
